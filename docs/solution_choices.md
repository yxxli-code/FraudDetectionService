# Solution Choices and Considerations
The following is a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of these four solutions for implementing a fraud detection system:

### Solution 1: Amazon SQS queue + a custom rule parser
- **Advantages**
    - **Simple and Easy to Use**: Amazon SQS is a simple message queue service, which is easy to set up and use. For teams that are not familiar with complex messaging systems, the difficulty of getting started is relatively low.
    - **Highly Customizable**: Using a custom rule parser, it is possible to carry out highly customized development according to specific fraud detection business requirements, and can accurately implement specific rule logic.
- **Disadvantages**
    - **Performance Limitation**: Compared with some specialized message middleware, SQS may have relatively low performance when processing high-concurrency messages, and may not be able to meet the requirements of large-scale real-time fraud detection.
    - **Lack of Real-time**: There is a certain delay in message processing of SQS. For fraud detection scenarios with high real-time requirements, messages may not be processed in a timely manner, resulting in untimely risk monitoring.
    - **Lack of Message Ordering**: Amazon SQS normally cannot guarantee the ordering of message sequences. It's not suitable for detecting consecutive events.
    - 
### Solution 2: Kafka (Amazon MSK) messages + a custom rule parser
- **Advantages**
    - **High Throughput and Low Latency**: Kafka is renowned for its high throughput and low latency characteristics, and it can handle a large number of real-time messages, making it suitable for large-scale fraud detection data processing.
    - **Strong Scalability**: The Kafka cluster, especially the Amazon Managed Service for Kafka(MSK), can be easily expanded to adapt to the growing business needs, and it can cope with high-concurrency fraud detection scenarios.
    - **Highly Customizable**: The custom rule parser can be developed according to the unique needs of the business to implement complex fraud detection rule logic.
- **Disadvantages**
    - **Controllable Development Cost**: It is necessary to develop and maintain a custom rule parser, which requires certain development resources and technical capabilities. 
    - **Difficult Rule Updates**: When the fraud detection rules change, it is necessary to modify and deploy the code of the custom rule parser, which may require a certain amount of downtime and affect the availability of the system. However, we can separate the rule parameters and rule logics so that rule parameters can be dynamically editable to avoid downtime.

### Solution 3: Kafka (Amazon MSK) messages + a rule engine like Drools
- **Advantages**
    - **Flexible Rule Management**: Drools provides flexible tools to manage and maintain rules without modifying the code.
    - **Powerful Rule Engine**: Drools can handle complex rule logic, which is suitable for various fraud detection scenarios.
    - **Hot Deployment**: It supports the hot deployment of rules without stopping the system, ensuring the continuity and availability of the system.
- **Disadvantages**
    - **Very High Learning Cost**: The use of Drools requires a certain learning cost, and developers need to be familiar with its rule language and framework. For teams that are not familiar with the rule engine, it may take a certain amount of time to master.
    - **Performance Overhead**: The rule engine will have a certain performance overhead when processing rules. For large-scale and high-concurrency message processing, it may affect the overall performance of the system.

### Solution 4: Kafka (Amazon MSK) messages + Flink CEP (AWS Kinesis) 
- **Advantages**
    - **Powerful Real-time Processing Ability**: Flink CEP is a framework specifically designed for complex event processing, and is very effective for real-time anomaly detection in fraud detection scenarios.
    - **Good Integration with Kafka**: Flink has good integration with Kafka, and it can conveniently read messages from Kafka for processing, ensuring the real-time and accuracy of data.
    - **Scalability and Fault Tolerance**: Flink has good scalability and fault-tolerance mechanisms, and it can run stably in a large-scale cluster environment, ensuring the reliability of the fraud detection system.
- **Disadvantages**
    - **High Complexity**: The use of Flink CEP is relatively complex, and developers need to master real-time stream processing knowledge, especially the knowledge about CEP.
    - **Difficult Rule Updates**: The user of Flink CEP requires to write the rule pattern into Flink Job code. If any rule update, it requires to restart flink job. It will be very complex to support dynamic rule updates.
    - **Difficult Configuration and Tuning**: Flink Jobs are managed by Flink Clusters outside Kubernetes(EKS) clusters. The configuration and tuning of Flink jobs require certain experience and skills.

In summary, 

Solution 1 is not a good choice to support real-time financial fraud detection which may have consecutive events and complex rules. I also set up Amazon SQS in this project as a comparison. The reason why I integrated it is that it's free and handy service provided by AWS; 

Solution 3 is also not a good choice since it has a very high learning cost and hard to tune the performance of rule engine, although its flexible rule management is a very outstanding feature.

Solution 4 is more appropriate for the big company who has a big development team with masters about flink CEP and ability to customize the Flink Cluster to support hot deployment of rules.

So I choose Solution 2 in this project since it can support high throughput, scalability, and rule customization with controllable development cost.
